	abstract = {Priority queues are fundamental abstract data structures, often used to manage limited resources in parallel programming. Several proposed parallel priority queue implementations are based on skiplists, harnessing the potential for parallelism of the add() operations. In addition, methods such as Flat Combining have been proposed to reduce contention, batching together multiple operations to be executed by a single thread. While this technique can decrease lock-switching overhead and the number of pointer changes required by the removeMin() operations in the priority queue, it can also create a sequential bottleneck and limit parallelism, especially for non-conflicting add() operations. In this paper, we describe a novel priority queue design, harnessing the scalability of parallel insertions in conjunction with the efficiency of batched removals. Moreover, we present a new elimination algorithm suitable for a priority queue, which further increases concurrency on balanced workloads with similar numbers of add() and removeMin() operations. We implement and evaluate our design using a variety of techniques including locking, atomic operations, hardware transactional memory, as well as employing adaptive heuristics given the workload.},

	abstract = {Two key synchronization paradigms for the construction of scalable concurrent data-structures are software combining and elimination. Elimination-based concurrent data-structures allow operations with reverse semantics (such as push and pop stack operations) to "collide" and exchange values without having to access a central location. Software combining, on the other hand, is effective when colliding operations have identical semantics: when a pair of threads performing operations with identical semantics collide, the task of performing the combined set of operations is delegated to one of the threads and the other thread waits for its operation(s) to be performed. Applying this mechanism iteratively can reduce memory contention and increase throughput. The most highly scalable prior concurrent stack algorithm is the elimination-backoff stack [5]. The elimination-backoff stack provides high parallelism for symmetric workloads in which the numbers of push and pop operations are roughly equal, but its performance deteriorates when workloads are asymmetric. We present DECS, a novel Dynamic Elimination-Combining Stack algorithm, that scales well for all workload types. While maintaining the simplicity and low-overhead of the elimination-bakcoff stack, DECS manages to benefit from collisions of both identical- and reverse-semantics operations. Our empirical evaluation shows that DECS scales significantly better than both blocking and non-blocking best prior stack algorithms.},

We introduce a new synchronization paradigm based on coarse locking, which we call flat combining. The cost of synchronization in flat combining is so low, that having a single thread holding a lock perform the combined access requests of all others, delivers, up to a certain non-negligible concurrency level, better performance than the most effective parallel finely synchronized implementations. We use flat-combining to devise, among other structures, new linearizable stack, queue, and priority queue algorithms that greatly outperform all prior algorithms.},

	abstract = {We present an efficient and practical lock-free implementation of a concurrent priority queue that is suitable for both fully concurrent (large multi-processor) systems as well as pre-emptive (multi-process) systems. Many algorithms for concurrent priority queues are based on mutual exclusion. However, mutual exclusion causes blocking which has several drawbacks anddegrades the system's overall performance. Non-blocking algorithms avoid blocking, and are either lock-free or wait-free. Previously known non-blocking algorithms of priority queues did not perform well in practice because of their complexity, and they are often based on non-available atomic synchronization primitives. Our algorithm is based on the randomizedsequential list structure called Skiplist, and a real-time extension of our algorithm is also described. In our performance evaluation we compare our algorithm with some of the most efficient implementations of priority queues known. The experimental results clearly show that our lock-free implementation outperforms the other lock-based implementations in all cases for 3 threads and more, both on fully concurrent as well as on pre-emptive systems.},

It permits a high degree of concurrency, yet it permits programmers to specify and reason about concurrent objects using known techniques from the sequential domain. Linearizability provides the illusion that each operation applied by concurrent processes takes effect instantaneously at some point between its invocation and its response, implying that the meaning of a concurrent object's operations can be given by pre- and post-conditions. This paper defines linearizability, compares it to other correctness conditions, presents and demonstrates a method for proving the correctness of implementations, and shows how to reason about concurrent objects, given they are linearizable.},

	abstract = {High-performance concurrent priority queues are essential for applications such as task scheduling and discrete event simulation. Unfortunately, even the best performing implementations do not scale past a number of threads in the single digits. This is because of the sequential bottleneck in accessing the elements at the head of the queue in order to perform a DeleteMin operation. In this paper, we present the SprayList, a scalable priority queue with relaxed ordering semantics. Starting from a non-blocking SkipList, the main innovation behind our design is that the DeleteMin operations avoid a sequential bottleneck by ``spraying'' themselves onto the head of the SkipList list in a coordinated fashion. The spraying is implemented using a carefully designed random walk, so that DeleteMin returns an element among the first O(p log{\textasciicircum}3 p) in the list, with high probability, where p is the number of threads. We prove that the running time of a DeleteMin operation is O(log{\textasciicircum}3 p), with high probability, independent of the size of the list. Our experiments show that the relaxed semantics allow the data structure to scale for high thread counts, comparable to a classic unordered SkipList. Furthermore, we observe that, for reasonably parallel workloads, the scalability benefits of relaxation considerably outweigh the additional work due to out-of-order execution.},
