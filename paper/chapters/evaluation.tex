\section{Evaluation}

This section describes the result of the empiric evaluation of both described algorithms.

\subsection{Single-Writer-Multi-Reader Lock Implementation}

For conducting the expiriments a Sun SPARC T5240 was used, which consists of two UltraSPARC T2 Plus chips with 8 cores each, running at 1.165~GHz. Each core provides 8 hardware threads, for a total of 128 threads (64 per chip). Each run was repeated 5 times. The median was used in the charts. Unfortunately the variance was not quantified in the paper. The throughput was measured in a timespan of 10 seconds. To get stable results the priority queue was seeded with 2000 initial elements. The decision wether to perform an \texttt{add()}-operation or an \texttt{removeMin()}-operation was done randomly with a probability of $p$ resulting in one operation and $1-p$ in the other operation.

The implementation was compared with 4 other priority queue implementations:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The flat combining skiplist (fcskiplist) and the flat combining pairing heap (fcpairheap) implementation are both based on the work of \citeauthor{hendler_flat_2010} and use coarse grained locking on a sequential datastructure with flat combining to implement a priority queue algorithm \cite{hendler_flat_2010}.
	\item The lock free skiplist (lfskiplist) by \citeauthor{sundell_fast_2003} is based on a parallel skiplist and uses no atomic primitive operations to achieve its lock-freeness. \cite{sundell_fast_2003}.
	\item The Lazy skiplist (lazyskiplist) by \citeauthor{lotan_skiplist-based_2000} is based on a parallel skiplist which uses a min-pointer and delete-flags to mark items as taken \cite{lotan_skiplist-based_2000}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hardware Transactional Memory Implementation}

To evaluate the performance of the hardware transactional memory implementation a Intel Core i7-4770 based computer was used. The four cores run at 3.4~GHz and provide two hardware threads each.

, with hardware transactions enabled (restricted transactional memory - RTM),
running at . There are 8GB of RAM shared across the machine and each core has a 32KB L1
cache. Hyperthreading was enabled on our machine so we collected results using all 8 hardware threads.
Hyperthreading causes resource sharing between the hyperthreads, including L1 cache sharing, when running
with more than 4 threads, thus it can negatively impact results, especially for hardware transactions. We
did not notice a hyperthreading effect in our experiments. We used the GCC 4.8 compiler with support for
RTM and optimizations enabled (-O3).

\subsubsection{Aborted Transaction Overhead}

\subsection{Comparison with algorithm by \citeauthor{braginsky_cbpq:_2016}}

\citeauthor{braginsky_cbpq:_2016} claim in their paper that they implemented a high performing parallel priority queue. They used the original sourcecode by \citeauthor{calciu_adaptive_2014} for conducting their evaluation. The evaluation environment used differs from the one used by \citeauthor{calciu_adaptive_2014}, as they used a machine with 4 16-core AMD Opteron (TM) 6272 processors having a total of 64 threads. The algorithms were all written in C++ and compiled with a -O3 optimization level on Ubuntu~14.04 \cite{braginsky_cbpq:_2016}.

Figures~\ref{fig:cbpq_50}, \ref{fig:cbpq_80} and \ref{fig:cbpq_20} show the results of the conducted experiments to compare the CBPQ algorithm by \citeauthor{braginsky_cbpq:_2016} to other high performing concurrent priority queu implementations at the time. The algorithm by \citeauthor{calciu_adaptive_2014} is abbreviated as APQ in the charts.
